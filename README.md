# LSTM Model for Classifying Dining-Related Actions

This repository contains the implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model designed to classify key dining-related actions using video or webcam data. The project demonstrates the complete pipeline from dataset analysis and data preparation to the creation, training, and real-time application of the model.

## Project Overview

This thesis project focuses on developing a model to recognize actions related to dining, such as eating, drinking, and speaking, by analyzing key facial features and gestures captured through video or webcam. The project includes:

- **Dataset Analysis**: Understanding and preprocessing the dataset to extract meaningful features for training.
- **Data Preparation**: Organizing and formatting the data to be compatible with the LSTM model.
- **Model Development**: Building and training an LSTM model to classify dining-related actions.
- **Real-Time Usage**: Implementing the model for real-time use with webcam or video input to recognize actions as they happen.
