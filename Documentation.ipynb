    "# 2: Data Extraction from Videos\n",

    "To prepare the input data for the model, it is necessary to extract features from videos while considering annotations. The extracted features are divided into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Keypoints\n",
    "Keypoints represent the 3D coordinates of specific body points, selected in this project from facial, hand, and body landmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization\n",
    "To eliminate influences caused by camera framing, video resolution, or subject size, the keypoints undergo a normalization process:\n",
    "- **Anchor-based Normalization**:  \n",
    "  - Facial keypoints are normalized relative to the nose as a fixed reference point.  \n",
    "  - Hand keypoints are normalized using the wrists as reference points.\n",
    "- **Body Size-based Normalization**:  \n",
    "  - Keypoints are normalized by dividing their coordinates based on the ratio between head height and torso width.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Descriptors\n",
    "Descriptors represent the distances between specific keypoints. These are carefully chosen to provide the model with relevant information for distinguishing actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Feature Extraction Process\n",
    "Features are extracted within the time intervals defined by video annotations. Annotations are padded with additional frames at the end to ensure that the total frame count matches the sequence length required by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Check\n",
    "Data is saved only if the annotations have more than 50% of frames where keypoints are successfully extracted. If not, both the data and the corresponding annotation are discarded. This precaution addresses situations where MediaPipe fails to extract keypoints due to occluded body parts, resulting in null data. This approach ensures that only reliable data is used for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Augmentation\n",

    "2. Using a horizontally flipped version of the video.\n",
